                    I had the great pleasure of serving among some of the finest  <br>
                    Americans in the United States Army. Service and sacrifice are  <br>

                    The men and women working on Oil and Gas drilling  <br>
                    rigs across the country demonstrated work ethic <br>
                    beyond measure. Working 100 consecutive 12 hour <br>
                    days on a drilling rig will leave one with a replenished <br>
                    bank account and an empowered soul. <br>

                    Leaving a lucrative career to chase the startup dragon is <br>
                    an adventure not to be taken lightly. I am proud to say <br>
                    that while the company may be defunct, some of the  <br>
                    technological breakthroughs and novel algorithms are 
                    still in use in the field today and adding value to the pio-  <br>
                    neering engineers who use them. <br>

                <p>
                    The nature of opportunity is a peculiar thing. A closed door in Oil  <br>
                    and Gas led to an open door building communication technology  <br>
                    serving personal injury attorneys across the United States. While  <br>
                    it would be a stretch to say Client Connect changes the world, I  <br>
                    am proud to say the customers are happy, the company is profit- <br>
                    able, and everyone had a positive outcome! <br>

                    Solving hard business problems with intuitive applications is what 
                    wakes me up in the morning. The exciting thing about the Butter-
                    fly Project is the dichotomy between the complecity of the prob- 
                    lem and the elegance of the solution.

                <p>The exciting thing about the Salesforce Ecosystem is that com-
